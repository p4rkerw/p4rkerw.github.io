# Graduate Student
The Wilson laboratory is recruiting a PhD candidate that will develop single cell and spatial analysis workflows in human and animal models of chronic kidney disease. This position involves a combination of wet lab and dry lab responsibilities, including preparation of tissue specimens for next-generation sequencing libraries, cell culture, assay development, and bioinformatics analysis of next-generation sequencing data. The candidate will work closely with Dr. Wilson and the Wilson lab team to learn proper laboratory techniques. Prior wet lab experience is not required, but the candidate would benefit from some experience in coding in R / Python / Shell or other languages. There will be a wide variety of opportunities to learn cutting-edge molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques that will be applicable to any career in the biomedical sciences. Prospective applicants should have a bachelors degree in a scientific or engineering field. Please send Dr. Wilson an email with your CV if you are interested in pursuing this opportunity. 

# Postdoctoral Fellow
The Wilson laboratory is hiring a post-doctoral fellow to work on an established project focused on single cell and spatial analysis of diabetic kidney disease. This position predominantly involves wet lab responsibilities, but applicants with experience in other areas will be considered. The post-doctoral fellow will conduct single cell analysis of human tissue specimens or animal models of kidney disease under the supervision of Dr. Wilson. We are looking for a motivated individual who can work together with our research team and complete any necesssary validation studies to move this project to publication. Prior coding experience is not required and the position can be tailored to the applicant skillset. Applicants with bioinformatics experience may be interested in single cell or spatial analysis techniques whereas applicants with molecular biology experience could focus on assay development and cell culture models of  kidney injury. There is a wide variety of opportunities in the Wilson lab for building independent projects. Please send Dr. Wilson an email with your CV if you are interested in pursuing this opportunity.
