# Postdoctoral Fellow
The Wilson laboratory is hiring a post-doctoral fellow to work on an established project focused on single cell and spatial analysis of diabetic kidney disease. This position involves both dry lab and wet lab responsibilities and will consider applicants with experience in either area. The post-doctoral fellow will conduct single cell analysis of human donor specimens from patients with diabetic kidney disease under the supervision of Dr. Wilson. We have already sequenced a large number of single cell libraries in collaboration with Novo Nordisk and preprocessed our dataset for downstream analysis. We are looking for a motivated individual who can work together with our research team and complete any necesssary validation studies to move this project to publication. Prior coding experience is not required and the position can be tailored to the applicant skillset. Applicants with bioinformatics experience may be interested in single cell or spatial analysis techniques whereas applicants with molecular biology experience could focus on assay development and cell culture models of diabetic kidney injury. There is a wide variety of opportunities in the Wilson lab for building independent projects. Please send Dr. Wilson an email with your CV if you are interested in pursuing this opportunity.

# Research Technician
The Wilson laboratory is hiring a research technician that will assist on new and established projects focused on single cell and spatial analysis of chronic kidney disease. This position predominantly involves wet lab responsibilities, including preparation of tissue specimens for next-generation sequencing libraries, cell culture, and assay development. The research technician will work closely with Dr. Wilson to learn proper laboratory techniques. Prior wet lab and/or dry lab experience is not required. There will be a wide variety of opportunities to learn cutting-edge molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques that will be applicable to any career in the biomedical sciences. Prospective applicants should have a bachelors degree in a scientific or engineering field. Please send Dr. Wilson an email with your CV if you are interested in pursuing this opportunity.
