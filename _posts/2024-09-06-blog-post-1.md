Dr. Jose Agraz, a postdoctoral fellow in the Wilson lab, shows how H&E stain normalization can enhance integration of whole slide imaging datasets. Digital pathology is an emerging field that has tremendous potential to change the way pathologists practice. Stain color normalization (SCN) will be critical to evaluate pathology specimens processed in different laboratories and help to enable image analysis.
