ThermoFisher recently interviewed me for their Absolute Gene-ius podcast to learn about how the Wilson lab has been using digital PCR to study somatic mosaicism. We have a Quantstudio Absolute Q digital pcr system and have designed custom assays to sensitively quantify chromosomal gains and losses in tissues like the kidney. These events are closely related to aging, cancer predisposition, and potentially kidney disease progression. Check out season 2 episode 11 "Somatic mosaic loss of sex chromosomes and kidney disease" to hear more about the Wilson lab and what it's like starting your career as a physician scientist.
