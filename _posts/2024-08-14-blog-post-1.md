The Wilson lab was one of six laboratories in the nation to receive a George M. O'Brien Kidney Resource Alliance (OKRA) Opportunity Pool Grant. This program is offered on a yearly basis and provides support to early-stage investigators in kidney research. The grant aims to quantify cell-specific mosaic structural variation in animal models of acute kidney injury using novel digital PCR and single-cell assays developed by the Wilson lab.
