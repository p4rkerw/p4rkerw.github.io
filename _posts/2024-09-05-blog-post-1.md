The Wilson lab partnered with the Zhang lab at the University of Pennsylvania and was awarded an R21 catalytic tools and technology grant from the NIDDK. This grant aims to develop novel methods for detection of somatic mosaicism in complex tissues like the kidney. These efforts include novel digital PCR and single-cell assays for sensitive and accurate quantification of mosaic structural variants in single cells.
