Wilson et al. used single-cell RNA, single-cell ATAC, and single-cell multiome (combined RNA + ATAC) sequencing to show that injured proximal tubule cells lose their Y chromosomes in aging and chronic kidney disease. This unexpected finding helps to further our understanding of the factors that contribute to successful and failed repair of kidney cells. Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY) was initially described in the blood and bone marrow and has long been associated with male aging. Cells with mLOY have a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and may injure neighboring healthy cells, leading to kidney disease progression. In addition, cells with mLOY are more likely to harbor additional mutations commonly associated with kidney tumors and could provide insight into cancer initiation. New tools and technologies to detect other types of mosaic structural variation will be needed to understand how somatic mosaicism contributes to aging and disease.
