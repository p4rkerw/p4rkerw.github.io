Dr. Wilson was among 50 physician-scientists to win a Young Physician Scientist Award (YPSA) from the American Society of Clinical Investigation. The ASCI Council Young Physician-Scientist Awards (YPSA) recognize physician-scientists who are early in their first faculty appointment and have made notable achievements in their research. With these awards, the ASCI seeks to encourage and inspire these physician-scientists through their participation in the annual meeting.

These awards provide a two-year longitudinal experience for 40 early-career awardees including:
- leadership development workshops
- topical panel discussions with ASCI members
- peer review groups
- virtual poster sessions
